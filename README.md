# Internet-Routing-Optimization
Dijkstra's Algorithm.  implementing and optimizing algorithms for data routing within a simulated Space-Based Internet (SBI) network
By applying Dijkstra’s algorithm within a graph structure that represents a network of satellites and ground stations, this project identifies the minimum-cost path between two nodes, improving the efficiency and reliability of data transmission within satellite communication networks.


Key Features:

Graph Data Structure: Models an SBI network as a connected, undirected graph, with vertices representing satellites or ground stations, and edges representing communication channels.
Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Utilizes Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm to calculate the minimum cost path between nodes, considering weights that reflect factors like bandwidth, delay, and error rates.
Custom Min-Heap: Implements a min-heap structure for efficient node handling in Dijkstra's algorithm, with methods for inserting nodes, finding and extracting the minimum node, and updating node distances.

Skills Demonstrated:

Implementation of advanced graph algorithms and a custom heap structure, showcasing knowledge in efficient data manipulation and pathfinding.
Comprehensive Java-based solution, handling complex data inputs and algorithm optimization.
Addressed practical constraints in satellite network design and routing, exploring real-world implications of algorithm choices in communication networks.
